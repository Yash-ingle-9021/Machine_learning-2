    "print(\"Q_7_ANS:- Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function. It introduces a bias towards simpler models and helps control the model's complexity. Regularization techniques constrain the model's parameter values, discouraging them from reaching extreme values and overfitting the training data. Here are some common regularization techniques:\\n\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 Regularization (Lasso):\\n\n",
    "L1 regularization adds the sum of the absolute values of the model's coefficients to the loss function. It encourages sparsity in the parameter values, effectively performing feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero. L1 regularization can set irrelevant or redundant features' coefficients to zero, leading to a more interpretable and concise model.\\n\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "2. L2 Regularization (Ridge):\\n\n",
    "L2 regularization adds the sum of the squared values of the model's coefficients to the loss function. It penalizes large parameter values, encouraging smaller and more evenly distributed coefficients. L2 regularization helps reduce the impact of individual features and prevents the model from relying too heavily on a small subset of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ElasticNet Regularization:\\n\n",
    "ElasticNet regularization combines both L1 and L2 regularization. It adds a linear combination of the L1 and L2 penalty terms to the loss function. ElasticNet allows for both feature selection (L1) and coefficient shrinkage (L2), providing a balance between sparsity and parameter distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dropout:\\n\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks. It randomly sets a fraction of the neurons' outputs to zero during each training iteration. This forces the network to learn more robust and generalized representations, as it cannot rely on the presence of specific neurons in the network. Dropout helps prevent overfitting by reducing the interdependence between neurons and improving the network's ability to generalize to unseen data.\\n\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Early Stopping:\\n\n",
    "Early stopping is a simple regularization technique that involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training. Training is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set starts to deteriorate. This prevents the model from excessively fitting the training data and improves generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These regularization techniques help prevent overfitting by introducing a bias towards simpler models and reducing the model's sensitivity to noise and fluctuations in the training data. By controlling the model's complexity and reducing the impact of individual features, regularization techniques improve the model's generalization performance and ability to perform well on unseen data. The specific choice of regularization technique depends on the problem, the model, and the data characteristics. \")"
